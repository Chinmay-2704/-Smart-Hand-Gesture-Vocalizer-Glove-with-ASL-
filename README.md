# -Smart-Hand-Gesture-Vocalizer-Glove-with-ASL-

A wearable **Smart Glove** designed to translate **American Sign Language (ASL)** gestures into text and speech in real-time.  
This project leverages **flex sensors, MPU6050 motion sensor, and touch sensors** integrated with **Arduino Nano** and **Bluetooth communication** to provide an affordable assistive tool for the speech and hearing-impaired community.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dual-Mode Operation**  
  - **ASL Mode:** Recognizes individual alphabets of American Sign Language to form words.  
  - **Predefined Gesture Mode:** Maps specific gestures to essential phrases (e.g., "Food", "Medicine", "Help").  

- **Real-Time Wireless Output**  
  - Uses **HC-05 Bluetooth module** to send translated gestures to smartphones/PCs.  
  - Displays output as **text or speech** via paired applications.  

- **Compact & Affordable Design**  
  - Custom PCB for efficient wiring and durability.  
  - Lightweight **3D-printed enclosure** for portability and comfort.  
  - Built under ₹3000, making it cost-effective compared to commercial alternatives.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Nano  
- Flex Sensors (5 units)  
- MPU6050 (Gyroscope + Accelerometer)  
- Touch Sensors (Silver Tape-based)  
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module  
- 9V Lithium Battery  
- Custom PCB + 3D Printed Enclosure

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Flex, motion, and touch sensors detect finger bends, hand orientation, and finger contacts.  
2. Arduino Nano processes sensor data using threshold-based logic.  
3. Interpreted gestures are transmitted wirelessly to paired devices.  
4. Output is displayed as **text or converted to speech** for real-time communication.

## 📊 Applications
- **Assistive Technology** – Helps speech and hearing-impaired individuals communicate effectively.  
- **Education** – Learning and teaching ASL in schools and institutions.  
- **Emergency Use** – Quick gestures mapped to essential commands (e.g., “Emergency”, “Need Help”).  
- **Future Scope** – Can be extended with **AI/ML for dynamic gesture recognition**, support for multiple sign languages, and mobile/cloud integration.
